<p class="text">  believe I adhered to the best practices visually by keeping the layout simple and easily understood.
 Headings and fonts are clear to read and understand.
The text was kept bold throughout because I thought it kept to the bands style better, their own logo being simple and bold.
 The same colour scheme was used throughout the site, so it flowed properly and users weren’t forced to gain a headache from loud, overcrowded colours.
Images were not used as a tool to convey a feeling on their own, so no tooltips were added. 
The images were picked to try give an impression of togetherness, but this was also explained in the written text.
The site is fully responsive it’s clear to understand on any device using media queries. 
A strength of websites now being responsive is that your site reaches a bigger audience, with most people today browsing on different devices. 
Another is that the code becomes easily adaptable for future released products. 
A weakness could possibly be the loading times on the devices if you use high end pictures or a lot of JavaScript. 
Also developing your site for mobile users risks you losing their engagement to it through text messages and social media. 
[1] The use of the site on any device is also why I opted for the 1 page layout with the navigation bar going to each specific section,
 I thought this to be better on swipe devices.
Social media links were provided at the bottom of the page to give users even extra information about the band, not restricted to just 
one thing. These links help the owner of the site reach a wider audience, gain more exposure and is free advertising [2].
 It also helps the user feel more connected to more people that like what is being advertised.
The actual coding I tried to keep consistent and well organised throughout, to make it easily understandable.
I believe the site content was kept simple enough to be accessible by most users.
